# ReactJS_BookstoreWebPage
In this project I have made a web page that uses restful api for backend. User interface was made with react js. 
In the web page there is a list of books -book name, author name, publisher- that is being displayed on the screen. For book
information, I have made a fake server on https://www.mockapi.io
